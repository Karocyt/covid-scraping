      "Abstract: Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, China has attracted world-wide attention. As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44,730 cases of pneumonia associated with the 2019-nCoV were confirmed by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China.    Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers.    Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5,405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.27 days with a standard deviation of 3.44 days, the incubation period having an average of 5.33 days with a standard deviation of 3.36 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days. The estimated controlled reproduction numbers, 𝑅𝑐 , produced by all three methods in all analyzed regions of China are significantly smaller compared with the basic reproduction numbers 𝑅0. Conclusions: The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to further keep/reduce the 𝑅𝑐 to below one in order to end the current epidemic.Funding Statement: The authors stated that they have no financial relationships (regardless of amount of compensation) with any entities.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare there is no conflict of interest.Ethics Approval Statement: The authors stated this was not required. \n",

      "Abstract: Background: Huge citizens expos social media during a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, China. We assess the prevalence of mental health problems and examine their association with social media exposure.  Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese citizens aged ≥18 years old during Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2019. Online survey was used to do rapid assessment. Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates.  Findings: The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China. More than 80% (95%CI:80.9%-83.1%) of participants reported frequently exposed to social media. After controlling for covariates, frequently SME was positively associated with high odds of anxiety (OR=1.72, 95%CI: 1.31-2.26) and CDA (OR=1.91, 95%CI: 1.52-2.41) compared with less SME.  Interpretation: Our findings show there are high prevalence of mental health problems, which positively associated with frequently SME during the COVID-19 outbreak. These findings implicated the government need pay more attention to mental health problems, especially depression and anxiety among general population and combating with “infodemic” while combating during public health emergency.Funding Statement: National key R&D Program of China (grant no. 2018YFC2002000 & 2018YFC2002001) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 71573048).Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests.Ethics Approval Statement: This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Fudan University, School of Public Health (IRB#2020-01-0800). \n",
